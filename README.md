# Video-Player-UI

A small collection of video player UI templates built as standalone HTML pages.  
Each file (`0`–`6`) represents a different UI variation/layout so you can compare designs quickly.

## What’s inside

Seven UI variants:

- `video player ui 0.html`
- `video player ui 1.html`
- `video player ui 2.html`
- `video player ui 3.html`
- `video player ui 4.html`
- `video player ui 5.html`
- `video player ui 6.html`

> Note: If your filenames differ slightly, update the list above to match your repo.

## How to run

### Option A: Open directly
1. Download/clone the repository.
2. Double-click any variant (for example, `video player ui 3.html`) to open it in your browser.

## Customize

Common quick edits (per variant):
- Change the video source: look for the `<video>` tag and update the `src` (or `<source src="...">`).
- Styling: edit the `<style>` section (if included) or any linked `.css` file.
- Controls/behavior: edit any `<script>` section (if included) or linked `.js` file.

## Screenshots / Demo (optional)

Add screenshots or a short GIF here to show each UI variant.
